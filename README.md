## StackOverflow Project

This project is designed to showcase the ability to build a sample react project. 
I've added some changes and features to represent some of my skills.

Stack Overflow project is a responsive website with "Roboto" font family used in the body. 
Icons are utilized from font awesome website.
The menu and hero section is looking almost the same with different functionality. 
Sign-up button links to a new page. By filling out the form and submitting it, users' info will appear under the form and inputs get empty. The goal was to use States and bind the form's inputs to the relevant state. Use useRef to focus on the name input each time the form gets submitted. 
To show the API and useEffect usage, by clicking on the "Join the community" button, it goes to a page that shows dummy posts from the "jasonplaceholder" website. Loader is appear till all data get uploaded. by clicking on "Read more" on each post, it goes to a new page and all its content will display.
